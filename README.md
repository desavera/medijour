1- Instructions to install and configure prerequisites or dependencies, if any

2- Instructions to create and initialize the database (if required)

3- Assumptions you have made - it is good to explain your thought process and the assumptions you have made

	One important assumption I have made was that I would be able to find a simple Authentication Service for OAuth2 and that social authentication providers are basically offering similar services by allowing a client to access some unique information from a user profile. That proved to be true as my choices in the security stack (i.e. Auth0 and Facebook) implementations are ready for extension.

4- Requirements that you have not covered in your submission, if any

5- Instructions to configure and prepare the source code to build and run properly

6- Issues you have faced while completing the assignment, if any

	As usual the lack of time to do a better job. Something that was not clear was how to provide the non copy requirement. I went through DRM but realized that streaming was a simpler solution.

7- Constructive feedback for improving the assignment

	I think you guys could bring in some management challenge as this position is for a management profile. All this coding is something I think I am taking advantage as I am a coder and never stopped programming but I would say you are losing several good candidates that will basically not even start coding as they have left this kind of task for a long time and that does not mean they are bad managers ! Just a braistorming on that issue...

	The task was interesting in deed.

thanks,

Mario.
